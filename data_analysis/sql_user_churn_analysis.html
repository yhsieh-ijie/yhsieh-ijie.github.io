                  <h3 class="major">User Churn Analysis</h3>
                  <p>Codeflix, a streaming video startup, is interested in measuring their user churn rate. Four months into launching Codeflix, management asked to look into subscription churn rates. It’s early on in the business and people are excited to know how the company is doing.
                     <br></br>The marketing department is particularly interested in how the churn compares between two segments of users.
                     They provide a dataset containing subscription data for users who were acquired through two distinct channels.
                     <br></br>The dataset provided contains one SQL table, subscriptions. Within the table, there are 4 columns:
                  <ol>
                     <li>id - the subscription id</li>
                     <li>subscription_start - the start date of the subscription</li>
                     <li>subscription_end - the end date of the subscription</li>
                     <li>segment - this identifies which segment the subscription owner belongs to</li>
                  </ol>
                  Codeflix requires a minimum subscription length of 31 days, so a user can never start and end their subscription in the same month.
                  <br></br>In this project, I focused on answering these questions about their churn:	
                  <ol>
                     <li>How many months has the company been operating?</li>
                     <li>Which months do I have enough information to calculate a churn rate?</li>
                     <li>What segments of users exist?</li>
                     <li>What is the overall churn trend since the company started?</li>
                     <li>Churn rates comparison between user segments?</li>
                     <li>Which segment of users should the company focus on expanding?</li>
                  </ol>
                  </p>
